# Predicting-Student-Test-Scores


This project focuses on predicting student test scores using machine learning techniques.
It aims to analyze how different factors affect academic performance.
The dataset includes features such as study hours, attendance, and previous scores.
Data preprocessing is performed to handle missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to understand data patterns and relationships.
Visualizations help identify correlations between features and test scores.
The project uses supervised learning algorithms for prediction.
